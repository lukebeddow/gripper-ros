How to generate a final sdf file for gazebo:

In the terminal (and in this directory) type:

$ xacro panda_and_eff.xacro > final.urdf

This runs xacro and generates a clean urdf. Next:

$ gz sdf -p final.urdf > final.sdf

This runs gazebo which parses the urdf (including gazebo tags) and generates a final sdf file.
