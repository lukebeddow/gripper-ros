This folder is set up to generate a set of objects to be included in MuJoCo in the form of mjcf files. In order to include objects into the mjcf model, you need a set of assets (meshes) as well as some boilerplate xml code which describes the object, gives it a name etc. In this folder, the asset information is stored in asset.xml files and the xml description code is stored in object.xml files. Auxillary information about each object is stored in details.xml.

The instructions for generating the objects (ie defining what objects and how many) is in define_objects.yaml. Edit this file to edit the object set.

The execution of those instructions is in create_objects.xacro. Edit this file to add new options/instructions and to understand how the instructions are implemented. This file essentially 'reads' define_objects.yaml and creates macros to generate the three output files (assets.xml/objects.xml/details.xml).

There are three .xacro files which actually create the outputs, these are assets.xacro, objects.xacro, and details.xacro. These are very basic files and should not need to be changed. All they do is make use of the macros defined in create_objects.xacro to actually make the outputs. These files should not be moved as the Makefile in the outer directory searches for them.

The assets and objects folder store sub-parts of the assets.xml and objects.xml files. These are random selections from the total object set, splitting it into smaller pieces. The files in this folder are generated by the xml_script.py file, and the names of these folders should not be changed without also editing that file.
